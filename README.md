# M-TEC MQTT

## Introduction
Welcome to the `M-TEC MQTT` project!

This project enables to read data from a M-TEC Energybutler (https://www.mtec-systems.com) system and write them to a MQTT broker. 

The highlights are:
* No additional hardware or modifications of your Inverter required 
* Just install on any existing (micro-)server, e.g. Rasperry Pi or NAS server 
* Works within you LAN - no internet connection required 
* Supports more than 80 parameters
* Clustered reading of sequential register to reduce modbus traffic and load 
* Enables frequent polling of data (e.g. every 10s)
* MQTT enables an easy integration into almost any EMS or home automation tool 
* Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) auto discovery via MQTT 
* Home Assistant demo dashboard included
* Easy and prepared integration into evcc (https://evcc.io), which enables PV surplus charging 

I hope you like it and it will help you with for your EMS or home automation project :-) !

### Disclaimer 
This project is a pure hobby project which I created by reverse-engineering different internet sources and my M-TEC Energybutler. It is *not* related to or supported by M-TEC GmbH by any means. 

Usage is completely on you own risk. I don't take any responsibility on functionality or potential damage.

### Credits
This project would not have been possible without the really valuable pre-work of other people, especially: 
* https://www.photovoltaikforum.com/thread/206243-erfahrungen-mit-m-tec-energy-butler-hybrid-wechselrichter
* https://forum.iobroker.net/assets/uploads/files/1681811699113-20221125_mtec-energybutler_modbus_rtu_protkoll.pdf
* https://smarthome.exposed/wattsonic-hybrid-inverter-gen3-modbus-rtu-protocol

### Compatibility
The project was developed using my `M-TEC Energybutler 8kW-3P-3G25`, but I assume that it will also work with other Energybutler GEN3 versions (https://www.mtec-systems.com/batteriespeicher/energy-butler-11-bis-30-kwh/).

It seems that there are at least three more Inverter products on the market which share the same (or at least a very similar) Chinese firmware. It *might* be that this API also works with these products. But since I do not have access to any of them, this is just a guess and up to you and your own risk to try it.

## MQTT server
The MQTT server `mtec_mqtt.py` connects to the espressif Modbus server of you M-TEC inverter, retrieves relevant data, and writes them to a MQTT broker (https://mqtt.org/) of your choice. 

You should be able to use it with probably any MQTT server. If you don't have one yet, you might want to try https://mosquitto.org/.

MQTT provides a light-weight publish/subscribe model which is widely used for Internet of Things messaging. MQTT connectivity is implemented in many EMS or home automation tools. 

## Setup & configuration
As prerequisites, you need to have installed: 
* Python 3.8 or higher
* PyYAML 
* PyModbus (> Version 3.6)
* paho-mqtt 

I recommend to install it in a `venv`.
The python modules can be installed easily by using `pip`:

```
pip install pyyaml
pip install PyModbus
pip install paho-mqtt
```

Now download the files of *this* repository to any location of your choise.
Then copy `config.yaml` from the `templates` directory to the project root.

Now you need to configure:
* Connection to your M-TEC Inverter
* Connection to your MQTT broker
 
### Connect your M-TEC Inverter
In order to connect to your Inverter, you need the IP address or internal hostname of your `espressif` device. 
If you run a FRITZ!Box, the pre-configured internal hostname `espressif.fritz.box` will probably already work out-of-the-box.
Else you can easily adjust it like this: 
1. Login to your internet router
2. Look for the list of connected devices
3. You should find a devices called `espressif`
4. Copy the IPv4 address or internal hostname of this device to `config.yaml` file as value for `MODBUS_IP`.

You probably don't need to change any of the other `MODBUS_` config values.

```
# MODBUS Server
MODBUS_IP : espressif.fritz.box    # IP address / hostname of "espressif" modbus server
MODBUS_PORT : 5743                 # Port (usually no change required)
MODBUS_SLAVE : 252                 # Modbus slave id (usually no change required)
MODBUS_TIMEOUT : 5                 # Timeout for Modbus server (s)
MODBUS_FRAMER: rtu                 # Modbus Framer (usually no change required; options: 'ascii', 'binary', 'rtu', 'socket', 'tls')
```

Hint for advanced users: If you run an external modbus adapter, connected e.g. to the EMS bus of the MTEC inverter, you might require to change the `MODBUS_FRAMER`.   

### Connect you MQTT broker
The `MQTT_` parameters in `config.yaml` define the connection to your MQTT server.

```
MQTT_SERVER : localhost     # MQTT server 
MQTT_PORT : 1883            # MQTT server port
MQTT_LOGIN  : " "           # MQTT Login
MQTT_PASSWORD : ""          # MQTT Password  
MQTT_TOPIC : "MTEC"         # MQTT topic name  
```

The other values of the `config.yaml` you probably don't need to change as of now.

That's already all you need to do and you are ready to go!

### Advanced config
Per default, the most interesting parameters are exported.
You can easily switch on/off the export of additional data packages: 

```
# Define which extended data shall get included
ENABLE_GRID_DATA : False         # Extended grid data
ENABLE_INVERTER_DATA : False     # Extended inverter data
ENABLE_BACKUP_DATA : False       # Extended backup data
ENABLE_BATTERY_DATA : False      # Extended battery data
ENABLE_PV_DATA : False           # Extended PV data
```

The `REFRESH_` parameters define how frequently the data gets fetched from your Inverter

```
REFRESH_NOW_S     : 10          # Refresh current data every N seconds
REFRESH_NOWEXT_S  : 30          # Refresh "now-" extended data every N seconds
REFRESH_DAY_M     : 5           # Refresh dayly statistic every N minutes
REFRESH_TOTAL_M   : 5           # Refresh total statistic every N minutes
REFRESH_CONFIG_M  : 60          # Refresh config data every N minutes
```

Please be aware that a frequent export of a lot of parameters increases the load on the `espressif` device of your Inverter. This might imply unwanted side effects. 

## Starting the service
Having done that, you should already be able to start `python mtec_mytt.py` on command line.
It will print out some debug info, so you can see what it does.

You can stop the service by pressing CTRL-C or sending a SIGHUB. This will initiate a graceful shutdown. Be patient - this might take some seconds.   

If you want to run the mqtt server as a service, you can find a `.service` template in the `templates` directory. 

### Home Assistant support
`mtec_mqtt.py` provides Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) auto-discovery, which means that Home Assistant will automatically detect and configure your MTEC Inverter. 

If you want to enable Home Assistant support, set `HASS_ENABLE: True` in `config.yaml`. 

```
# Home Assistent
HASS_ENABLE : True                # Enable home assistant support
HASS_BASE_TOPIC : homeassistant   # Basis MQTT topic of home assistant
HASS_BIRTH_GRACETIME : 15         # Give HASS some time to get ready after the birth message was received
```

As next step, you need to enable and configure the MQTT integration within Home Assistant. After that, the auto discovery should do it's job and the Inverter sensors should appear on your dashboard.

If you want, you can use and install the `hass-dashboard.yaml` in `templates` for a nice data visualization. 
The map view requires to install `PV_background.png` as background image. To do so, create a sub-directory called `www` in the `config` directory of your Home Assistant installation (e.g. `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/www/`) and copy the image to this directory.  

### evcc support
If you want to integrate the data into evcc (https://evcc.io), you might want to have a look at the `evcc.yaml` snippet in the `templates` directory. It shows how to define and use the MTEC `meters`, provided in MQTT.
Please don't forget to replace `<MTEC_SERIAL_NO>` with the actual serial no of your Inverter.

## Data format written to MQTT

The exported data will be written to several MQTT topics. The topic path includes the serial number of your Inverter.
 
| Sub-topic                         | Refresh frequency            |  Description 
|---------------------------------- | --------------------------   | ---------------------------------------------- 
| MTEC/<serial_number>/config       | `REFRESH_CONFIG_M` minutes   | Relatively static config values     
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-base     | `REFRESH_NOW_S` seconds      | Current base data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-grid     | `REFRESH_NOWEXT_S` seconds   | Current extended grid data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-inverter | `REFRESH_NOWEXT_S` seconds   | Current extended inverter data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-backup   | `REFRESH_NOWEXT_S` seconds   | Current extended backup data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-battery  | `REFRESH_NOWEXT_S` seconds   | Current extended battery data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/now-pv       | `REFRESH_NOWEXT_S` seconds   | Current extended PV data      
| MTEC/<serial_number>/day          | `REFRESH_DAY_M` minutes      | Daily statistics     
| MTEC/<serial_number>/total        | `REFRESH_TOTAL_M` minutes    | Lifetime statistics     

All `float` values will be written according to the configured `MQTT_FLOAT_FORMAT`. The default is a format with 3 decimal digits.

This diagram tries to visualize the power flow values and directions: (at least from my understanding)
<pre>
     + ->               + ->                    + -> 
PV  -------  inverter  ------- power connector ------- grid                
              |    |                |
            ^ |    | +            + |
            + |    | v            v |

## What else you can find in the project?

### Modbus Utility
`mtec_util.py` is an small inteative tool which enable to list the supported parameters and read and write registers of your Inverter.
You can choose between:

 * 1: List all known registers
 * 2: List register configuration by groups
 * 3: Read register group from Inverter
 * 4: Read single register from Inverter
 * 5: Write register to Inverter

(1) lists all know registers. This includes the ones which are written to MQTT as listed above. You will find a few more registers, which are not mapped to MQTT (=no value in "mqtt") - mostly because I'm not sure if they are reliable or what they really mean.   

(2) will give you a list of all mapped registers, similar to the one listed above.

(3) allows you to read the current values of all registers or of a certain group from your Inverter.

(4) allows you to read a sinfle register from your Inverter

(5) enables you to write a value to a register of your Inverter. WARNING: Be careful when writing data to your Inverter! This is definitively at your own risk!

### Commandline export tool
The command-line tool `mtec_export.py` offers functionality to read data from your Inverter using Modbus and export it in various combinations and formats.

As default, it will connect to your device and retrieve a list of all known Modbus registers in a human readable format.

By specifying commandline parameters, you can:
* Specify a register group (e.g. `-g config`) or "all" (`-g all`) to export of all registers
* Provide a customize list of Modbus registers which you would like to retrieve, e.g. `-r "33000,10105,11000"`
* Request to export CSV instead of human readable (`-c`) 
* Write output to a file (`-f FILENAME`)

### Templates 
In the `templates` directory you can find some more useful templates:
* `hass-dashboard.yaml`: A dashboard which visualizes all Inverter data within Home Assistant. 
* `evcc.yaml`: A yaml snippet shich shows how to integrate your Inverter into evcc.
* `mtec_mqtt.service`: A template which shows how to create a systemctl service running `mtec_mqtt.py`
